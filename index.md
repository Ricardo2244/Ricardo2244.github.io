### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was my favorite lab because it involved coding a game that I was pretty familiar with which is blackjack. This lab also made me feel more confident about my own skills and made me realize that I was capable of coding. This lab also helped me learn how to write functions revolving around the arguments.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was another favorite because I really liked how it could be used for real life scenarios. The thought that people make codes that can make a person's life simpler is interesting because most of the time it goes without notice but now I feel like appreciate the process. This lab especially helped me with learning how to implement math equations in to the function.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 is also one of my favorites because it was the first time if statements were introduced and I thought it was amazing how much you can do with them. It was extremely fun using the if statements to create multiple situations and ways to end the game. My biggest take away would be using the if statements to make alternate paths or endings.
